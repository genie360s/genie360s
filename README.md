## About Me 🥷🏾

#### Software Engineering | Data Analysis | Community Building | UI & UX Design

This is Alex Mkwizu 🧔🏾‍♂️, a passionate problem solver ⚙️ who believes 💭 in solving problems 🛠️ and evaluating ⚖️the best way to scale them through technology 👨🏾‍💻 to reach a large base of the community 👥. I am proficient with Python 🐍 and my best framework is Django. I use the HCD (Human Centred Design ) approach to tackle problems best at their core 🔥. I use Figma to design the best UI 🎨 ( User Interfaces ) and use my creative skills to curate the best UX 🖌️ ( User Experience ) for the system users 🧍 . 

I love technical communities as my journey in software development started there. I build, mentor and consult student tech communities. I have been a Hub manager at the University Of Dar es Salaam ICT Hub ( Udicti ) where I helped fellow students learn technical skills by hosting expert sessions with industrial experts, teaching in workshops and hosting hackathons. Partaken in designing and implementing the Smart Girls In ICT Program as a community outreach program for Udicti Hub to the secondary girls students to spike their interest in STEM subjects, Innovation and Entrepreneurship reaching more than 1500+ girls.

NB: My community has currently partnered with DataCamp Donates to offer 350 Datacamp scholarships incase you are interested to be a beneficiary  :  https://bit.ly/dcscholarship24

## Github Campus Expert :octocat:

Currently, I am a GitHub campus expert 🐙 , where I work hand in hand with fellow campus experts in organising technical workshops, hackathons, tech career fairs and Twitter spaces that aim to build sustainable tech communities where students learn technical skills relevant to the current market and a chance to network with professionals in the IT space. Also, raise awareness of the GitHub Education Pack and the GitHub Campus Expert Program benefits and how students can leverage them.
